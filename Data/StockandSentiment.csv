Most profits came from $VXX strangles and day-trading $QQQ through all the volatility... 
 
Pruned OTM $GME &amp; $CAVA when IV was through the roof on Wednesday... 
 
Also finally covered my full $PLTR short position (in profit) that&#39;s been haunting me since Jan 13th lol

Emerging science meets MainzBiomed. 
Recent studies reveal mRNA’s active role in DNA repair, including: 
m⁵C methylation recruiting repair proteins (RAD51/52) 
RNA:DNA hybrids stabilizing broken DNA strands 
Here’s where МYNZ may be ahead of the curve: 
🧬 Their platform already detects cancer via mRNA biomarkers. 
But now? That same tech could potentially track DNA repair dysfunction — key to cancer risk, progression &amp; therapy response. 
Мainz’s ColoAlert &amp; PancAlert tests: ✅ Spot abnormal mRNA tied to repair genes (like BRCA1/2 loss) 
✅ Could evolve to monitor mRNA methylation &amp; repair signals 
✅ Open door to dual-layer diagnostics: mutation + repair status 
📈 The market&#39;s just waking up to this. 
This isn’t just early detection. It’s next-gen precision oncology. 
NASDAQ: МYNZ  might not just find the cancer — it may soon predict how it behaves.

(which leads me to expects this is QNX Based as well)

I am sharing my response to the post below by @Jorlev because this is not the first time I have seen this accusation, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the last. Therefore, I wanted to respond more broadly. 
 
The post below implies I have some ulterior motive for posting the analyst reports I have been posting and I am being dishonest when I say I have no position. 
 
To be very clear, my motivations with these posts stem from the first sentence in my profile statement...namely, &quot;Make your life a gift to others.&quot; 
 
You see...I believe the poster below cannot believe somebody would do something without seeking personal financial gain because that is the way he lives his life. However, not everyone has the same world view.  
 
To me, there are more valuable things in life than just money. I have been fully living out that theory for the last 12 years of my life and I can tell you I have never been happier. 
 
As I also stated in the pinned post in my profile, one of the reasons I have been posting these reports is because I wanted to introduce retail traders to the actual reports themselves and the way professional firms communicate to their clients.  
 
Am I paid to do this? No. I am doing it because I thought it would benefit the community and relationships are actually more important to me than money. 
 
I hope that makes it clear to anyone questioning my motives. Further, IMHO, a big life lesson is not assume everyone else in the world has the same value system that you have. Sometimes, you can be completely wrong. 
Again, just MHO.

trump tweeted “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” just FOUR hours before the tariff announcement — a clear market-moving event

accidentally on the mic, he bragged that charles schwab made $2.5 billion and another individual made $900 million that same day

sht I bet white house staffers who were aware of the tariff delay had SPY 0dte calls 😂😂😂

The market was hugely overvalued and still is by about 20%.   It was a simple normal correction.  Yes, triggered the tariffs, but certainly not caused by them.  If the S&amp;P PE had been in the normal 15-20 range instead of the 30 it was at, the tariffs would have caused hysteria in the media but little concern in the stock markets.

This rare signal has only been triggered 24 times since 1950. The 200DMA signal is triggered once the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 200DMA records its first five-day loss, measured as two points over five trading days. This loss signals the beginning of a downtrend and therefore always anticipates further losses in the future. The 23rd trigger for this signal occurred during the 2022 bear market, and the signal was used to prepare for the possibility of a lower bottom than what appeared at the time to be a major bottom. The 24th trigger occurred on April 7, 2024, as the stock market continued to slump in the wake of massive tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States on the rest of the world. This 24th trigger appears even more ominous because it occurred as the S&amp;P 500 fell 17.6% from its all-time high, the third-largest 200DMA loss on record (since 1956).",0.1413888888888889

Attached is page 1 of a 1o-page Morgan Stanley analyst report on AAPL issued yesterday entitled: 
 
&quot;New Thoughts on Apple&#39;s Tariff Mitigation Tools&quot; 
 
Morgan Stanley has an &#39;Overweight&#39; rating on AAPL with a $220 price target. 
 
Morgan Stanley&#39;s summary statement regarding AAPL in the report includes the following: 
 
&quot;As we consider how Apple mitigates 125% China tariffs, a new line of thinking has emerged that doesn&#39;t involve like-for-like iPhone price increases. Instead, fast-ramping India production and targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind. We detail our thoughts below. 
 
What if Apple doesn&#39;t raise like-for-like iPhone prices? Since tariffs on Chinese imports were first introduced in early March, the consensus expectation has been that Apple will be forced to raise iPhone prices to offset the consistently increasing cost of tariffs on Chinese imports (at 125%… for now). We&#39;ve shared similar thoughts, and already expressed our concerns about the impact that higher prices could have on iPhone volumes, moreso in FY26 than FY25. As we&#39;ve had more time to think about potential mitigation efforts, a new train of thought has emerged.&quot;",0.11318181818181819

Will the warrant MOMOron please S da elf up??? Warrant basics dude. Like kindergarten level:     @kevinFlint  
Dude has no shame or ability to learn basics yet just keeps on. 
 
1. Intrinsic Value: A warrant allows the holder the right to purchase shares at a predetermined exercise price. When the market price of the underlying stock is less than the exercise price, the warrant is referred to as &quot;out of the money.&quot; In this scenario, exercising the warrant doesn&#39;t make sense financially since the holder could buy shares at a cheaper price on the open market  
 
2 . Exercising Out of the Money: If a warrant holder chooses to exercise a warrant when the stock is trading below the exercise price, they would effectively be paying more for the shares than they would if they simply bought them on the market. Therefore, warrants are typically only exercised when they have intrinsic value, meaning the exercise price is below the stock&#39;s market price",0.1523809523809524

On Friday, the yield shot as high as 4.58% before sliding back to around 4.50%. That’s a major swing for the bond market, which measures moves by the hundredths of a percentage point. 
 
Among the possible knockoff effects is a big hit to ordinary Americans in the form of higher interest rates on mortgages and car financing and other loans. 
 
“As yields move higher, you’ll see your borrowing rates move higher, too,” said Brian Rehling, head of fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “And every corporation uses these funding markets. If they get more expensive, they’re going to have to pass along those costs customers or cut costs by cutting jobs. 
 
“This is Econ 101,” said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global, adding about the bond sell-off now, “It’s left people scratching their heads.”",0.006093750000000002

Attached is page 1 of a 7-page Wedbush analyst report on MSFT issued today entitled: 
 
&quot;Tariff Game of Poker Causing More Cap-Ex Uncertainty; Lowering PT to $475&quot; 
 
Wedbush has an &#39;Outperform&#39; rating on MSFT with a $475 price target. 
 
Wedbush&#39;s summary statement regarding MSFT in the report includes the following: 
 
&quot;Over the last week we have seen an economic Twilight Zone hit the US economy as the tariff slate was unveiled by Trump last week and now paused for 90 days...with the bond market/rising 10-year ultimately forcing Trump&#39;s hand in our view. This has created real damage to the corporate spending mentality and as such we are cutting estimates for Microsoft&#39;s June and 2026 estimates and lowering our price target from $550 to $475.&quot;",-0.008333333333333331

In the base case, the 20% US value (tariff exemption for goods w/ more than 20% US value) is interpreted as brand-based—meaning American brands are more likely to secure exemptions for complete systems or finished products.  
 
In the worst case, retaliatory tariffs from other countries escalate the trade war &amp; the US value is defined strictly based on the manufacturing location, which significantly increases the risk of market contraction

You don’t make America great by bleeding your companies dry with protectionism.
You make America great by:

- Offering fiscal incentives so foreign investors rush to invest in your businesses.
- Presenting big national projects — infrastructure, technology, AI — to inspire global confidence.
- Giving companies room to grow, not strangling them with higher costs and uncertainty.
- Protecting the consumer&#39;s purchasing power, keeping the economy alive and strong.

What Trump is doing now is the exact opposite:
- He drives up costs for businesses.
- He scares away international investors.
- He forces consumers to pay more.
- And by the time he talks about “investments,” companies will already be weakened beyond repair.

Trade tariffs aren&#39;t a win.
They are slow economic suicide.

&quot;We see a decision in JNJ’s new Daubert challenge, expected in 2H25, as the next key event in the talc litigation. A win for JNJ could at least weaken the plaintiff’s case or possibly even lead to dismissal of MDL cases and discourage future cases.&quot;",0.053636363636363635

Johnson &amp; Johnson announced results from additional analyses of the Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 double-blind study and the ongoing open-label extensiona, evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of investigational nipocalimab in a broad population of antibody-positive adults with generalized myasthenia gravis. Patients treated with nipocalimab plus standard of care maintained improvements in their MG-ADLc and QMGb scores over 84 weeks with sustained reductions in total immunoglobulin G (IgG).1  
 
These data are included in a presentation and are among 12 abstracts that Johnson &amp; Johnson will present at the American Academy of Neurology 2025 Meeting in San Diego, California, which includes an oral presentation on QMG score improvements from the double-blind phase of the Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 study. Nipocalimab demonstrated a mean change in MG-ADL of -5.64 from the double-blind baseline after 60 weeks in the OLE for study participants receiving nipocalimab and SOC, and -6.01 mean change for study participants who transitioned from placebo and SOC to nipocalimab and SOC.  
 
In the antibody-positive population, 45% of patients receiving steroids at the OLE baseline were able to decrease or discontinue steroids at the time of this data cut by more than half of the baseline dose. Among these patients, the mean dose of prednisone decreased from 23 to 10 mg per day. Nipocalimab had a consistent and tolerable safety profile throughout the OLE phase.  
 
Additional findings from the Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 double-blind study indicate that patients treated with nipocalimab plus SOC achieved statistically significant improvements in their QMG score by -4.9 versus placebo plus SOC over weeks 22 and 24.2 Patients in the nipocalimab plus SOC treatment group were four times more likely to sustain symptom improvement at 20 weeks compared to the placebo plus SOC group, as measured by a three or greater point improvement on the QMG score. 
 
Results show significantly more patients treated with nipocalimab versus placebo spent greater than 75% of study duration demonstrating improvements in the QMG score. A reduction of more than three points in the QMG score indicates a decrease in the severity of the patient&#39;s symptoms as a result of improvements in muscle strength, allowing patients to carry out important daily activities such as swallowing and chewing.",0.12430555555555554

No one will be able to afford anything, and product revenue will plummet except for the most dire of medical necessities - if we can even get them.

These data, presented at the 2025 World Congress of Pediatric Dermatology Annual Meeting, show adolescents treated with once daily icotrokinra achieved higher rates of clear or almost clear skin at Week 16 compared to patients receiving placebo with no new safety signals identified.  
 
Icotrokinra is a first-in-class investigational targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor and is being studied in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO. In the study, 84.1% of adolescent patients treated with once daily icotrokinra achieved an Investigator&#39;s Global Assessment score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear skin) and 70.5% achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 90 response, compared to 27.3% and 13.6% receiving placebo, respectively, at Week 16.  
 
Response rates continued to improve through Week 24 where 86.4% of adolescents achieved IGA 0/1 (clear or almost clear skin) and 88.6% achieved PASI 90. Further, at Week 24, 75% of adolescents achieved IGA 0 (completely clear skin) and 63.6% achieved PASI 100.",0.08728956228956232
