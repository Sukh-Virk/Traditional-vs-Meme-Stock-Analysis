stocks,China Vows to ‘Fight to the End’ If US Insists on New Tariffs,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vows-fight-end-us-011817316.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vows-fight-end-us-011817316.html)

China slammed the US for threatening to raise tariffs and pledged to retaliate if Washington follows through, raising the stakes of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

“The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmail nature of the US,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a Tuesday statement. “If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”

Beijing and Washington are already on track to raise blanket tariffs on each other this week. Trump on Monday added a new threat to put an additional 50% levy on Chinese imports.

US threats and pressure are “not the right way to engage” with China and the nation will defend its interests, China’s embassy in Washington said.

“The US hegemonic move in the name of ‘reciprocity’ serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries’ legitimate interests and puts ‘America first’ over international rules,” embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in response to a question on the latest US move.

stocks,It feels like this might be the denial phase. I hope I'm wrong.,"To me it seems like the Trump administration wants to send a knife straight through China. At all costs. To avoid public backlash from delivering a sufficient blow, they need to give the illusion of negotiation and dial the beat of the drum high enough to drown out opposing analysis. Anything less than a concerted, three-dimensional strike will allow China to ""weasel"" away and re-entrench elsewhere by ""cheating"" as is often brought up. (China+1, tax havens)

stocks,News eToro and Klarna halt US IPO plans due to market instability,"eToro and Klarna have decided to halt their plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for the US following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. 

Since US President Donald Trump announced additional sweeping tariffs on goods imported from abroad on 2 April 2025, the whole world has been in turmoil, with many regions responding to the move. Even if Trump believes that these tariffs could expand the US economy and encourage consumers to buy more American-made goods, leaders from around the world underlined that his initiative could lead to significant consequences for people globally. Also, according to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo), South Korean officials stated that the global trade war has now become a reality, while Canadian representatives highlighted the region’s plans to act with purpose and force. At the same time, worries about a trade war brought stocks down after Trump released the sweeping tariffs plan that could negatively impact the worldwide economy.

Considering the current situation and the high market volatility, many companies seeking a US IPO decided to delay their plans. Among them are Klarna and eToro, as well as Medline and StubHub, with all of them citing market instability as the reason for their choice.

# Klarna and eToro’s decision to delay US IPO

According to sources familiar with the matter cited by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/klarna-pauses-us-ipo-plans-amid-tariff-turmoil-wsj-reports-2025-04-04/), Klarna momentarily put a stop to its arrangements for the US IPO. The move could obscure the recovery of the US IPO market, as Klarna’s listing was considered a potential stimulus for supporting other companies to take a similar approach. However, as per the same sources, the Swedish fintech could re-examine its plans if market conditions become more stable and favourable. A research analyst from IPOX mentioned that this type of market uncertainty could lead any company, regardless of the sector it operates in, to pause its near-term IPO plans.

Furthermore, eToro, an Israel-based social trading-focused online broker, which filed for a US IPO at the beginning of [February 2025](https://thepaypers.com/cryptocurrencies/etoro-confirms-ipo-filing-with-us-authorities--1272263), also postponed its preparations for the offering. As detailed by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/trump-s-trade-war-hits-billions-of-dollars-of-deals-in-24-hours), the company aimed to start its investor roadshow in the upcoming period. However, with the recent tariffs and market instability, it has stalled it indefinitely.

stocks,Forget Money Markets go with UDN - Inverse Dollar ETF,"If you are sitting out of the market in money market funds, congrats!  You were able to preserve your capital.  However, there is a thesis to Trump devaluing the dollar next and to protect your capital from that, US based money market funds isn’t going to cut it.

I base this thesis off of Stephen Miran’s paper [A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf).  In this paper Miran discusses enacting the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacting tariffs (at 20%), and devaluing the dollar.  Trump has done steps 1 and 2 so far.  One way that the President can devalue the dollar without Congress is through imposing fees on foreign US Treasury holders.  

But tariffs are supposed to strengthen the dollar!  Even Miran mentions the dollar could go up at the beginning of tariffs.  With restricted imports the trade deficit will be reduced which could raise the dollar however, in the medium term we have other countries placing tariffs on the US, an economic slowdown, and investor uncertainty.  Add to that Trump potentially actively looking to lower the dollar and in the next few months the dollar could be crushed.

USD denominated money markets make about 4% right now.  UDN (the inverse dollar ETF) has already risen 6% YTD.  If the dollar gets seriously devalued though that 4% isn't going to matter much to the world economy and one way to protect your account is to invest in UDN in the next month or so.

Would love to hear your take on this.

&gt; Late last week, as stocks across the globe lurched lower in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz, a striking pattern emerged in the $10 trillion US market for exchange-traded funds.

&gt; No fewer than eight of the 13 most-traded ETFs on Friday were funds that use options to offer juiced-up or inverse returns of various indexes or single stocks. In fact, the top four comprised a triple-leveraged bet on semiconductor stocks, an amped-up bullish wager on Tesla Inc., a vehicle promising three times the performance of the Nasdaq 100, and the latter’s bearish sibling.

&gt; The world’s biggest and most-liquid ETF, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, was fifth on the list, even as it lured $9.4 billion in new cash.

&gt; Many of these funds are popular among the retail-trading crowd, with do-it-yourself investors gravitating toward them to take high-conviction bets on all manner of asset classes or single stocks.

&gt; Broadcom Inc., a supplier of semiconductors to Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, announced plans to buy back as much as $10 billion in shares, saying it remains confident in the chip industry.

&gt; The board has authorized the repurchase through Dec. 31, Broadcom said in a statement Monday. The announcement sent the company’s shares up about 3% in late trading.

&gt; The stock had been down 34% this year through the close of regular New York trading, part of a broader tech rout fueled by tariff concerns.

&gt; The buyback “reflects the board’s confidence in the strength of Broadcom’s diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software product franchises,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in the statement. The Palo Alto, California-based company is “uniquely positioned” to help large cloud-computing companies adopt generative artificial intelligence, he said.",0.93,24,1744066703.0
stocks,Apple’s 3-day loss in market cap swells to almost $640 billion,"While the stock market broadly fared better on Monday than in the prior two trading days, Apple got hammered once again, losing 3.7%, as concerns mounted that the company will take a major hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The sell-off brings Apple’s three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that has wiped out $638 billion in market cap.

Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, analyst say, due largely to its reliance on China, which is facing 54% tariffs. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump’s sweeping plan.

Among tech’s megacap companies, Apple is having the roughest stretch. On Monday, the only stocks to drop in that group of seven were Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.

The Nasdaq finished almost barely up on Monday after plummeting 10% last week, its worst performance in more than five years.

Analysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple’s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.

Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.

Apple declined to comment on the tariffs.

10:10am - Fast rally into positive territory

10:13am - The claimed triggering tweet that 'Hasset said there will be a 90-day pause' is posted. 

10:17am - The rally peaks, and shortly after multiple stations begin reporting that a flash rally was caused by a ""Fake News"" mistake about a 90-day rally.

stocks,"Here's the Actual Trade War Strategy, and how it will likely Unfold","1. Create a sense of urgency by announcing massive ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which act as the anchor for future negotiations.

2. Make an example out of any country that attempts to retaliate(ie China), to show it's not a bluff.

3. As negotiations take place, the US stays firm, trying to get more out of a deal. The US will stand firm and exercise restraint with deals. Why? Because deals will be public, and every other country will expect the same treatment. Therefore, the US has an incentive to stall until they have fielded offers from everyone, and then only announce the most favorable deals first, to set a baseline for expectations.

4. The white house had to reject rumors of considering a 90-day delay, even if true, because it would've killed their leverage. What is far more likely is much shorter delays for select countries that make compelling offers. We saw this a lot with Canada &amp; Mexico months back.

5. The white house knows it is on a timer. Republicans are already starting to break with their party and vote on bipartisan bills to limit the president's tariff authority. Right now this can be vetoed. But if the trade war goes on long enough and does enough damage, and voters lose trust in the president, the senate/house can get the numbers to override the president. But this won't happen until Trump's approval rating drops considerably.

6. Given this urgency, there is likely an intent to backtrack and establish new deals that are more favorable to the US. However, this cannot be communicated publicly, because doing so would be bad for negotiations(other side needs to think the US is content keeping tariffs in place).

So we may see a bit more of a downturn as uncertainty remains, but most likely, either deals will be made, or congress will intervene once things get bad enough. Therefore, panic selling is a bad idea for long term investors.",0.2,0,1744051334.0
stocks,"Your fear is already ""priced in"".","A common mistake beginners make is believing they can outperform the market simply by following the news. This rarely, if ever, works, even on those infrequent occasions when the market appears to move exactly as predicted based on current events.

For instance, if you feel pessimistic about the market's prospects, it's highly probable that many others share that view and have already acted upon it by selling their holdings or establishing short positions. Therefore, the decline you might anticipate based on your negative outlook isn't necessarily a future event; that fear and negativity are likely already reflected in the current price levels.

They wait for unambiguously positive news before feeling confident enough to invest, but by that time, prices are often inflated, and the significant opportunity has passed.

This isn't to definitively claim that we've already reached the absolute bottom. However, it highlights a fundamentally flawed strategy: reacting directly to news cycles and herd sentiment. A more effective approach often involves acting contrary to the prevailing crowd behaviour.

Frankly, whether the current market movement is the final bottom or merely a ""dead cat bounce"" (a temporary recovery during a longer-term decline) is somewhat irrelevant to a sound investment strategy. Trying to perfectly time the market is a futile exercise. The most reliable approach is to focus on acquiring assets at prices you deem fundamentally attractive, irrespective of short-term noise or news headlines. Forget trying to trade the news; it's a game that is exceedingly difficult to win consistently. Focus on identifying good value and investing for the longer term.",0.4,0,1744051058.0

So much sadness, anger and worry in the world being reflect on Reddit. I just saw a legit post on a financial/trading sub for a suicide hotline. Wow. I feel you. 

I would just like to offer a little hope from a stoic philosophical mindset and life outlook I adopted from living a life that was largely out my control:

**You cannot control the external events happening around you. You can only control how you react to them.**

None of us can control any of this shit storm right now. Everyone has been betrayed whether they are aware of it or not. And the betrayal started long ago. We are just seeing the symptoms of it more and more as time goes on. Hate towards each other is not the answer nor will it make anything better. The best ""medicine"" you can take is to keep your cool and look out for one another. I don't know what ""medicine"" has been fed to the stock market but the side effect is obviously: ""*may turn red for many days.*"" As the old proverb states: ""*This too shall pass.*"" 

\*I am asking for this post: Can we please chill with the political BS? 

Let's move on to what we can control- our reactions and strategy. With that, why not buy Docusign ($DOCU)? You can't really put tariffs on an electronic agreement company. They aren't dependent on foreign supplied components, raw materials, movement of physical goods, or anything else being disrupted by tariffs. And thankfully, their CEO seems rather smart, sane, and not currently involved in global politics. They are an online based technology company that is globally accessible. From their own website:

""*Docusign is the global leader in electronic signature with more than a billion users in more than 180 countries worldwide.*""

Think about that for a minute. Every country, just about every business, and even a few penguins on the Heard and McDonald Islands are going to be scrambling to make adjustments. What does that mean? Lots of agreements will need to be inked really fast all over the globe. What is the fastest way to do that? Electronically. That is what Docusign does. I expect that Docusign will directly profit from all this chaos that will need to be reorganized by the entire world of business and government. 

My position: I first bought into Docusign after it collapsed post-COVID. I bought more after it dropped when the Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman acquisition attempt fell through. I'm still up and there is no way I am panic dumping it.

I would like to buy more once the current chaos calms. My questions are this: 

1. Are there any fundamental flaws with this theory that you can see? 
2. Do you think the overall markets will just pull Docusign down with it regardless if they outperform? 
3. If you thinks this makes sense, when would you buy? I get the logic behind all the quips like ""*don't try to catch a falling knife*"" and other similar such sayings. The stock is basically right where it was last November. So, it hasn't really sold off dramatically if you are thinking long and I am not trying to time this perfectly (nor is it possible).

All of the things that’ve happened over the past couple months of the Trump presidency seem to make logical sense if you look at the markets from a perspective of centralized control (FED+massive collusion).

Think about it: nothing Trump’s done really flies in the face of US economic policy over the past 60 years since the start of the Cold War and US economic imperialism. Bretton Woods, fiat currency, IMF - all these things served the US. If the plan (and yes there was a plan according to declassified documents from the Kissinger era) was to create dependency on the US dollar and massive public debt, the end game was inescapable inflation worldwide - which would in the short term drive demand for the US dollar and cause massive value inflows into the US as world markets crashed. The US dollar would inflate last, but it would be beside the point because the US has the largest gold reserves in the world. It would also create a massive buying opportunity for US firms sitting on cash (in the short term). 

Cash is valueless - the end objective is OWNERSHIP of assets worldwide. Towards this end, the plan seems to be working perfectly. However, certain things have not gone to plan - BRICS, Bitcoin, and the general apathy of the American public’s nationalism seem to have had a weakening effect on the plan. The plan doesn’t seem as smart as it did 60 years ago.

What if Trump is the planned scapegoat for the deleveraging of inflated markets? If he acts as the lightning rod, markets could potentially be stabilized to sane valuations for at least a couple years, no? The end result of his actions will be his impeachment - there’s too much money being ‘lost’ (remember, it doesn’t exist in the market - it’s just perceived value because the amount of currency circulating doesn’t change).

But they cost four times as much. Inflation never really went away. Interest rates stayed high for years to “tame inflation” but all it did was tame hope. BRRRR machine stopped working after they ran out of printer inks made in China. 

Mortgage rates are still above 8%.
401(k)s are flat. American dream now: never retire, never die, keep the GDP alive.

But hey, we made it back!!!!

stocks,"Dow falls 1,000 points in wild session as Trump tariff market collapse continues: Live updates","U.S. stocks were slammed for a third day on Monday as the White House remained defiant even after President Donald Trump’s rollout of shockingly high tariff rates on most key U.S. trading partners has caused a market meltdown.

Stocks mounted a short-lived rally shortly after the open that took the Dow Jones Industrial average into positive territory. Speculation of some sort of tariff pause circulated on trading floors and social media and may have contributed to the pop. The White House told CNBC that any talk of a 90-day pause was “fake news.”

stocks,WARNING: The AI Party Might Be Over - Especially After This 20% Market Crash,"Let's have a serious conversation about Artificial Intelligence and the current state of the market. Over the past couple of years, AI has been the undisputed darling, fueling massive gains in countless stocks, often with little more than an ""AI"" tag attached. We've seen valuations reach dizzying heights, driven by excitement and the fear of missing out on the next big thing.

However, the market has just delivered a brutal wake-up call. In the past few days, we've witnessed a significant 20% crash across major indices. This sudden and sharp downturn throws a glaring spotlight on the unsustainability of many inflated asset prices, and I believe the AI sector is particularly vulnerable to a painful reckoning.
Here's why this 20% market drop could be the pin that bursts the AI bubble:

 * Exposed Overvaluations: Many AI companies, especially those without substantial revenue or proven profitability, were trading at premiums based purely on future potential. This 20% market correction forces a rapid reassessment of risk. Investors are now far less willing to pay exorbitant prices for future promises, and AI stocks with weak fundamentals will likely be the first to suffer a severe correction.

   * Think about it: That small AI startup with a groundbreaking-sounding algorithm but no actual sales? Their sky-high valuation just became incredibly difficult to justify in a market that has suddenly shed 20% of its value.

 * Shift to Safety and Fundamentals: In times of market turmoil, investors tend to flock to safer assets and companies with proven earnings and strong balance sheets. The speculative nature of many AI investments makes them prime candidates for a sell-off as investors prioritize capital preservation over high-risk, high-reward bets.

   * Consider: Why would an investor hold onto an unproven AI stock with a questionable path to profitability when they can invest in established, profitable companies that have also become cheaper due to the broader market decline?

 * Liquidity Concerns and Margin Calls: A 20% market crash can trigger margin calls and force investors to liquidate their holdings to cover losses. Highly leveraged positions in volatile sectors like AI could be particularly at risk, leading to a cascading effect of selling pressure.

 * The ""AI Narrative"" Loses Its Grip: The powerful narrative of AI as a guaranteed path to endless growth is being challenged by the harsh reality of a falling market. Investors are likely to become more critical and demand concrete results rather than simply buying into the hype. Disappointing earnings or slower-than-expected adoption of AI technologies will be punished severely.

 * Increased Scrutiny and Regulation: A market downturn often leads to increased scrutiny of high-growth sectors. Regulators might become more concerned about potential asset bubbles and take a closer look at the AI industry, potentially introducing measures that could further dampen investor enthusiasm.
What should you be doing right now?

 * Take Immediate Stock: Review your portfolio and identify your exposure to AI-related stocks. Understand the underlying fundamentals of these companies – are they actually generating significant revenue and profit, or are they primarily riding the AI wave?

 * De-Risk Aggressively: If you have significant gains in AI stocks, consider taking profits off the table. Reduce your exposure to highly speculative AI companies, especially those with stretched valuations.

 * Focus on Quality and Value: Shift your focus towards companies with strong fundamentals, proven business models, and reasonable valuations. The broader market sell-off might present opportunities in more stable sectors.

 * Prepare for Further Volatility: A 20% market drop can be just the beginning of a larger correction. Be prepared for continued volatility and potential further declines in high-growth sectors like AI.

 * Don't Buy the Dip Blindly: Be extremely cautious about ""buying the dip"" in AI stocks without a clear understanding of their long-term value and resilience in a potentially challenging economic environment.

This 20% market crash isn't just noise; it's a potential inflection point. The easy money fueled by AI hype might be gone, and the market is now demanding tangible results. If you're heavily invested in AI without a strong fundamental basis, now is the time to seriously reconsider your strategy before the potential bubble fully deflates.

What are your thoughts? How is this market downturn impacting your view on AI investments?

	2.	Where should I actually be investing? Or resources to help me?
